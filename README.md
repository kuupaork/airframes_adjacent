# Airframe Adjacent

A random collection of scripts and things for various bits of [Airframes.io](https://airframes.io/). Nothing here is officially connected to Airframes.io. I'm a happy feeder and hang out in the Discord, but not attached to the project in any capacity. It is very cool.

Currently:

## dumbhfdl.py

An optimizing frequency picking harness for `dumphdl`. Also with a script for empirical scanning, and a naive packet analyser to match with the empirical scanner.
